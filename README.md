# Palette
A Python utility to create color palettes based off of an image. Uses k-means clustering to generate eight different RGB shades based off of the predominant colors of the source image.

Tested for Python 3.7, but should work for Python 3.0+

# How To Use

Download/clone somewhere on your computer and download the requirements in the [Pipfile](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Put the source image in the same directory and then run the program with python. It will ask you for the name of the source image; type it and press Enter. In a few seconds it will display the palette, which you can then save wherever.
